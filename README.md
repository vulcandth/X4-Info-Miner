# X4 Information Miner

This repo contains 2 scripts to extract information from X4 Foundations. The one you want to use is the savefile miner: `x4-save-miner.py`, the second script `x4-cat-miner.py` is for extracting data from the game files for use with the save miner.

The only requirement besides the standard python libraries is lxml
```
pip3 install lxml
```

## x4-save-miner

The `x4-save-miner.py` script is used to extract useful information from any save file. By default it runs at a low information level and only reveals the sector information, running at higher info levels reveals more "spoilers". The choice is yours.

Usage:
```
usage: x4-save-miner.py [-h] [-o] [-l] [-d] [-e] [-c CODE] [-p] [-w] [-r] [-x] [-k] [-K] [-X XML] [-q] [-i INFO] [-f] [--player] [--distance] [--avoid-illegal-sectors] [--avoid-hostile-sectors] [-s] savefile

positional arguments:
  savefile              The savegame you want to analyse

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o, --ownerless       Display ownerless ship locations
  -l, --lockboxes       Display lockbox locations
  -d, --datavaults      Display Data Vault locations
  -e, --erlking         Display Erlking Data Vault locations
  -c CODE, --code CODE  Display location of the items with code
  -p, --proximity       Display The proximity to the closest station
  -w, --whereswally     Display player location information
  -r, --wrecks          Include wrecks in output
  -x, --xenon           Display Xenon ship locations
  -k, --khaak           Display Khaak ship locations
  -K, --khaakstations   Display Khaak Station locations
  -X XML, --xml XML     Dump the XML for a specific resource by code
  -q, --quiet           Suppress warnings in interactive mode
  -i INFO, --info INFO  information level [1-3]. Default is 1 (sector only)
  -f, --factions        Display faction relative strengths
  -t [N] [C], --trades [N] [C]  Show the top N profitable ware trades using at most C cargo (default N=5)
  --player              Factor the player's ship location, cargo space and credits into trade ranking
  --distance            Rank trades by profit per kilometre
  --avoid-illegal-sectors  Avoid trades through sectors where the ware is illegal
  --avoid-hostile-sectors  Avoid trades through sectors hostile to the player
  -s, --shell           Starts a python shell to interract with the XML data (read-only)
```

`--avoid-hostile-sectors` skips trades if either station is in a hostile sector
and searches for routes that do not pass through hostile territory from the
player's current position to the destination. Unowned sectors are considered
neutral, so travelling through them is always allowed. If there is no gate route
between two stations in different sectors the trade is ignored.  `--avoid-illegal-sectors`
only avoids illegal sectors on the leg from the seller to the buyer.

Using `--player` with the trades option ranks deals by profit per kilometre and automatically limits them by your ship's cargo space and available credits.

The savefile can be compressed or uncompressed. It is the importing of the data that takes most of the time, once imported accessing the data is fast.

The flags are not mutually exclusive, you can use them all together. eg:

```
$ ./x4-save-miner.py ~/.config/EgoSoft/X4/11524914/save/quicksave.xml.gz -olde -i2
```

The amount of information displayed depends on the `-i`,`--info` setting. At level `1` it will display only the sector in which the object resides, level `2` will also show the position within the sector (x,y,z in meters), and level `3` will show you the components on board. 

For example, getting the ownerless ships at level `1` (the default) returns information like:
```
$ ./x4-save-miner.py ~/.config/EgoSoft/X4/11524914/save/quicksave.xml.gz -o

Ship: IKP-411, Class: ship_l, Macro: ship_par_l_destroyer_01_a_macro
  SpawnTime: 0
  Sector: Faulty Logic VII (XXL-865)
```

Running at level `2` would return:
```
$ ./x4-save-miner.py ~/.config/EgoSoft/X4/11524914/save/quicksave.xml.gz -o -i2

Ship: IKP-411, Class: ship_l, Macro: ship_par_l_destroyer_01_a_macro
  SpawnTime: 0
  Sector: Faulty Logic VII (XXL-865)
  Location: {'x': -165396, 'y': -489, 'z': 145876, 'pitch': 0, 'roll': 30, 'yaw': -111}
```

And at level `3` it would return:
```
$ ./x4-save-miner.py ~/.config/EgoSoft/X4/11524914/save/quicksave.xml.gz -o -i3

Ship: IKP-411, Class: ship_l, Macro: ship_par_l_destroyer_01_a_macro
  SpawnTime: 0
  Sector: Faulty Logic VII (XXL-865)
  Location: {'x': -165396, 'y': -489, 'z': 145876, 'pitch': 0, 'roll': 30, 'yaw': -111}

You can also pass `-p` to get the proximity to the closest station in the sector. Using `-p` will (obviously?) provide information at level: 2. 

Here's an Erlking Vault example. The nearest station has code JSV-655, and the vault is 151 KM to the West (left) and 46 KM to the North (up) of that station. It's also 26 KM above the station. 

```
Vault: ZFN-855, Known2Player: True
  Sector: Windfall III The Hoard (EXA-561)
  Location: {'x': -233300, 'y': 23136, 'z': -44598, 'pitch': 0, 'roll': 0, 'yaw': 0}

            The closest station is: JSV-655, distance: 160 km
            Target is 151 km to the west (X Axis)
            Target is 46 km to the north (Z Axis)
            Target is 26 km above (Y Axis)

```
Note: The proximity is show in KM, the location (x,y,z) on the line above is in meters.

An example of Erlking Data Vaults:

```
$ ./x4-save-miner.py -e ~/.config/EgoSoft/X4/11524914/save/quicksave.xml.gz -i3

As you can see, I have opened three vaults and the remaining two still have wares and blueprints inside.

### Interactive Mode
You can also poke around inside your save file by starting the script in interactive mode. In this mode, python will parse the save file into an `lxml.etree` structure and then drop you into an interactive interpreter.

```
$ ./x4-save-miner.py -s ~/.config/EgoSoft/X4/11524914/save/quicksave.xml.gz

Python Shell starting...

Available Functions: 

  getShips('code')          # Fetch information about a specific ship code (returns an array of ships)
  getStations('code')       # Fetch information about a specific station (returns an array of stations)
  getObjects('code')        # Fetch information about any object with a code (returns an array of objets)
  getSectors('code')        # Fetch information about a specific sector (returns an array of sectors)
  getSectorObjects('code')  # Fetch stations and ships currently inside the given sector
  printXML('code')          # Print the XML for a resource and its children
  getDupes('code')          # Fetch all duplicates or those with provided code
  dumpDupes('code')         # Print all duplicates or those with provided code

Fetch interesting (special) resources

  setLevel(int)                                          # Set information level for print functions
  update[Ownerless|LockBoxes|DataVaults|ErlkingVaults]() # Update locations for these objects
  print[Ownerless|LockBoxes|DataVaults|ErlkingVaults]()  # Print these objects information

  Eg. Display the ownerless ship locations:

  >>> updateOwnerless()
  >>> printOwnerless()

Or you know, just use python. The root of the xml tree is in var `root`. Other vars include:
lists:      sectors duplicates warnings allComponents allStations allShips freeShips
            xenonShips khaakShips dataVaults erlkingVaults lockboxes flotsam other
dicts:      sectorNames sectorCodes shipCodes stationCodes vaultCodes lockboxCodes allCodes
            ignoredConnections sector_zone_offsets sector_macros

  >>> print(json.dumps(dict(phq.attrib), indent=6)) 
  >>> printShip(getShips('ULC-584')[0],3)

### Duplicate codes

You probably thought that those station and ship codes were unique. Well that's not necessarily the case, I have many duplicates in some of my save games and you may have too. This wont cause an issue when printing data using one of the flags [`-o`,`-l`,`-d`,`-e`], but it is something to bear in mind if you go poking around in interactive mode. The functions should warn you if you request data which has a duplicate though. 

From version 1.0.3, the getShip() and similar functions have been replaced with getShips() and similar which return an array of matching items.

```
$ ./x4-save-miner.py -s ~/.config/EgoSoft/X4/11524914/save/quicksave.xml.gz 

Python Shell starting...

WARNING: Duplicate code found for: NMQ-431
WARNING: Duplicate code found for: XYT-702
WARNING: WARNING: Duplicate is another SHIP. Two or more ships have the same code: XYT-702
WARNING: Duplicate code found for: KSR-468
WARNING: Duplicate code found for: YRS-090
... SNIP ...
```

These dupes are not a problem for the game, because each object also as an `id` which is unique and I'm sure that's how the resources get managed by the game engine.

## x4-cat-miner

The `x4-cat-miner.py` script is used to extract offset information from zones/regions from the CAT/DAT files shipped with game. This information is necessary in order to be able to locate objects in space using co-ordinates from the centre of any sector. It also parses the language files to map the identification codes to their languages.

You do not need to run this unless Egosoft releases a new DLC or you want to change the language in the other scripts output (the files in this repo are configured for English).

Usage:
```
usage: x4-cat-miner.py [-h] [-l LANGID] x4folder

positional arguments:
  x4folder              The location of your X4 installation

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LANGID, --langid LANGID
                        The language ID for names (default == 44 (English))
```

The langid is the language id for the name mappings. The default is `44` which I think is UK English.

It will generate two json files `x4-names.json` which maps the cluster/sector/zone macros to their system names, and `x4-offsets.json` which maps the macros to their three dimensional offsets. Both of these files will then be used by the `x4-save-miner` script to provide useful information from your save files.

## scan_x4_archives.py

A supplemental utility to scan the game's CAT/DAT archives for specific numeric values inside XML files.

**Requirements:** Python 3, `lxml`, and optionally `python-lz4` to handle LZ4-compressed entries.

**Usage:**
```bash
pip install lxml         # if not already installed
pip install lz4          # optional, for LZ4 compression support

python3 scan_x4_archives.py [--debug] /path/to/X4\ Foundations
```

The `--debug` flag prints the first 200 characters of each XML entry as read from the DAT archive, useful for verifying decompression.
